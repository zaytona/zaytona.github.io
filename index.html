          <h4><i class="fa fa-plus-square-o"></i> High Quality</h4>

          Our team believes in a culture centered around the needs of our customers by desinging and implementing solutions which bring measuable values to the customer.  Our customer-centric attitude extends beyond the inital phase of development and delivery of a project; rather, it extends into continued maintenance and support for the lifetime of the project.

          <h4><i class="fa fa-plus-square-o"></i> Top Talent</h4>

          We attract stellar candidates to our team who transform their passion for technology into user friendly solutions and products.  Developers are constantly improving their skills by learning new technologies and exposing themselves to areas outside their current expertise.

          <h4><i class="fa fa-plus-square-o"></i>  Development process </h4>

          We keep our customers engaged in all phases of the development process and maintain an open feedback cycle to allow quick response to the immeidate and long term needs of our clients.  We practice short development iterations (sprints) and maintain code quaility through peer code reveiw and multiple modes of quality assurance (QA).
